      <p class="abstract">Abstract</p>
      <p>Zones are the building blocks of urban analysis. Fields ranging from
      demographics to transport planning routinely use zones — spatially
      contiguous areal units that break-up continuous space into discrete
      chunks — as the foundation for diverse analysis techniques. Key
      methods such as origin-destination analysis and choropleth mapping
      rely on zones with appropriate sizes, shapes and coverage. However,
      existing zoning systems are sub-optimal in many urban analysis
      contexts, for three main reasons: 1) available administrative zoning systems are
      often based on somewhat arbitrary factors; 2) evidence-based zoning
      systems are often highly variable in size and shape, reducing their
      utility for inter-city comparison; and 3) official zoning systems are non-existent,
      not publicly available, or are too coarse, hindering urban analysis
      in many places, especially in low income nations.
      To tackle these three key issues we developed a
      flexible, open and scalable solution: the ClockBoard zoning system.
      ClockBoard consists of 12 segments divided by concentric rings of
      increasing distance, creating a consistent visual frame of reference
      for cities that is reminiscent of a clock and a dartboard. This paper
      outlines the design, potential uses and merits of the ClockBoard
      zoning system and discusses future avenues for research and
      development of new zoning systems based on the experience.</p>

<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#introduction" class="anchor"></a>Introduction</h1>
<p>Zoning systems have long been used for a variety of administrative and practical purposes.
Zones demarcating parcels of land have been integral to land ownership, rents and urban policies for centuries, forming the basis of a range of social and economic practices.
Historical examples highlighting the importance of zone layouts include ‘tithe maps’ determining land ownership and taxes in 18th Century England <span class="citation">(Bryant and Noke 2007)</span> and the division of cities into discrete areas including legally defined “business, industrial, and residential zones” to tame chaotic urban growth in the exploding US cities in the early 1900s <span class="citation">(Baker 1925)</span>.</p>
<p>In the 19th Century, zoning systems became known for political reasons, with ‘gerrymandering’ entering public discourse and academic research following Elbridge Gerry’s apparent attempt to gain political advantage by creating an electoral district in an odd shape that was said to resemble a salamander (hence the term’s name combining ‘Gerry’ and ‘salamander’) in 1812 <span class="citation">(Orr 1969)</span>.
Gerrymandering has since been the topic of countless academic papers that is the beyond the scope of the present paper.</p>
<p>Research research has made great progress in mathematical analysis of zones and more objective assessment of the impacts that the nature of zoning systems can have on zone-based statistics (such as number of votes for a particular party in each zone) and outcomes.
The gerrymandering problem (in itself is a manifestation of the modifiable area unit problem) can be described as a mathematical optimization problem: “<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> units are grouped into <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> zones such that some cost function is optimized, subject to constraints on the topology of the zones” <span class="citation">(Chou and Li 2006)</span>.
Much research has demonstrated the sensitivity of urban analysis outcomes to zone system design, from the way cities are visualised to the <a href="http://www.iasi.cnr.it/ewgt/13conference/145_binetti.pdf">impact of the nature of ‘traffic analysis zones’ on transport model outputs</a>.
In fact, this problem is concise definition of the broader “zoning problem” that starts from the assumption that zones are to be composed of one or more basic statistical units (BSUs) <span class="citation">(Jelinski and Wu 1996; Chandra et al. 2021)</span> .
Although the range of outcomes is a finite combinatorial optimisation problem (which combination of BSU-zone aggregations satisfy/optimise some pre-determined criteria) the zoning problem is still hard: “there are a tremendously large number of alternative partitions, a similar number of different results, and only a slightly smaller number of different interpretations” <span class="citation">(Openshaw 1977)</span>.</p>
<p>The problem that we tackle in this paper is different, however.
It is ‘zoning from scratch’: the division of geographic space into zones <strong>starting from a blank slate</strong>, without reference to pre-existing areal units.
The focus of much preceding zoning research on BSU partitioning can be explained by the fact that much geographic data available to academics comes in ‘pre-packaged’ small areas and because creating zones from nothing is a harder problem.
We disagree with the statement that “existence of individual or non-spatially aggregated data is rare in geography” <span class="citation">(Openshaw 1977)</span>, pointing to car crashes, shop locations, species identification data and dozens of other phenomena that can be understood as ‘point pattern processes’.
And with advances in computer hardware and software, the ‘starting from scratch’ approach to zoning system is more feasible.</p>
<p>A number of approaches have tackled the question of how to best divide up geographical space for analysis and visualisation purposes, with a variety of applications.
Functional zone classification is common in the field of remote sensing and associated sub-fields involved in analysing and classifying raster datasets <span class="citation">(Ciglic et al. 2019; Hesselbarth et al. 2019)</span>.
While such pixel-based approaches can yield complex and flexible results (depending on the geographic resolution of the input data), they are still constrained by the building blocks of the pixels, which can be seen as a particular type of areal unit, a uniformly sized and shaped BSU.</p>
<p>In this paper we are interested in the division of <em>continuous space</em> into completely new areal systems.
This has been done using contour lines to represent lines of equal height, and the concept’s generalisation to lines of equal journey time from locations (isochrones) <span class="citation">(Long 2018)</span>, population density (isopleths) <span class="citation">(Lin, Hanink, and Cromley 2017)</span> and model parameters which continuous geographical space <span class="citation">(P’aez 2006)</span>.
The boundaries created by these various ‘iso’ maps are ‘procedurally generated’ areal units of the type that this paper focuses, but their variability and often irregular shapes make them impractical for many types of urban analysis.</p>
<p>Procedural generation, which involves the generation of data through a repeated and sometimes randomised computational process has long been used to represent physical phenomena <span class="citation">(Onrust et al. 2017)</span>. The approach has been used to generate spatial entities including roads <span class="citation">(Galin et al. 2010)</span>, indoor layouts of buildings <span class="citation">(Anderson et al. 2018)</span> and urban layouts <span class="citation">(Mustafa et al. 2020)</span>. Algorithms have also been developed to place linear features on a map, as illustrated by an algorithm that optimizes the placement of overlapping linear features for cartographic visualisation <span class="citation">(Teulade-Denantes, Maudet, and Duchêne 2015)</span>.
However, no previous research has demonstrated the creation of zoning systems specifically for the purposes of urban analysis.</p>
<p>New visualisation techniques are needed to represent new (or newly quantifiable) concepts and emerging datasets (such as OpenStreetMap) in urban analysis analysis .
The visualisation of direction has been driven by new navigational requirements and datasets, with circular compasses and displays common in land and sea navigational systems since the mid 1900s <span class="citation">(Honick 1967)</span>. Circular visualisation techniques, in the form of rose diagrams, were used in a more recent study to indicate the most common road directions relative to North <span class="citation">(Boeing 2021)</span>. The resulting visualisations are attractive and easy to interpret, but are not geographical, in the sense that they cannot meaningfully be overlaid on mapped data. The approach we present in this paper is more closely analogous to ‘grid sample’ approaches used in ecological and population research <span class="citation">(Hirzel and Guisan 2002)</span> . Historically, environmental researchers have used rectangular (and usually square) grids to divide up space and decide sampling strategies. Limitations associated with this simplistic strategy have been documented since at least the 1960s, with a prominent paper on geographic sampling strategies outlining advantages and disadvantages of simple random, systematic and stratified sampling techniques in 1967 <span class="citation">(Holmes 1967)</span>. Starting with data at the level of raster grid cells and BSUs, a related approach is to sample from within available ‘pixels’ to generate a representative sample <span class="citation">(Thomson et al. 2017)</span>.</p>
<p>Unlike BSU based zoning systems, grid sampling strategies require no prior zones.
Unlike ‘procedurally generated’ areas, grid-based strategies generate areal units of consistent sizes and shapes.
However, grid-based strategies are limited in their applicability to urban research because they seldom generate geographically contiguous results and do not account for the strong tendency of human settlements to have a (more-or-less clearly demarcated) central location with higher levels of activity.</p>
<p>Pre-existing zoning systems are often based on administrative regions.
Although those zoning systems are usually in line with the hierarchical organization structure of governmental organizations, and therefore may work well for policy making, there are a couple of downsides to using such zoning systems.
First of all, since a city and its politics change over time, the administrative regions often change accordingly.
This make it harder to do time series analysis.
Since the administrative regions have heterogeneous characteristics, for instance population size, area size, proximity to the city centre, comparing different administrative regions within a city is not straightforward.
Moreover, comparing administrative regions across cities is even more challenging since average scale of an administrative region may vary a lot across cities.</p>
<p>Grid tiles are popular in spatial statistics for a number of reasons.
Most importantly the tiles have a constant area size, which makes comparably possible.
Moreover, the grid tiles will not change over time like administrative regions.
However, one downside is that a grid requires a coordinate reference system (CRS), enforcing (approximately) equal area size.
For continents or large countries, a CRS is always a compromise.
Therefore, the areas of the tiles may vary, or the shape of the tiles may be sheared or warped.</p>
<p>Another downside from a statistical point of view is that population densities are not uniform within a urban area, but concentrated around a centre.
As a consequence, high resolution statistics is preferable in the dense areas, i.e. the centre, and lower resolution statistics in other parts of the city.
That is the reason why administrative regions are often smaller in dense areas.</p>
<p>The approach presented in this paper aims to minimise input data requirements, generate consistent zones comparable between widely varying urban systems, and provide geographically contiguous areal units.
The motivations for generating a new zoning system and use cases envisioned include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Locating cities.
Automated zoning systems based on a clear centrepoint can support map interpretation by making it immediately clear where the city centre is, and what the scale of the city is.</p></li>
<li><p>Reference system for everyday life.
The zone name contains information about the distance to the center as well as the cardinal direction.
E.g “I live in C12 and work in B3.” or “The train station is in the center and our hotel is in B7”.
Moreover, the zones indicate whether walking and cycling is a feasibly option regarding the distance.</p></li>
<li><p>Aggregation for descriptive statistics / comparability over cities.
By using the zoning system to aggregate statistics (e.g. on population density, air quality, bicycle use, number of dwellings), cities can easily be compared to each other.</p></li>
<li><p>Modelling urban cities.
The zoning system can be used to model urban mobility.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The paper is structured as follows.
The next section outlines the approach, which requires only 2 inputs: the coordinates of the central place in the urban system under investigation, and the minimum radius from that central point that the zoning system should extend.
Section 3 describes a number of potential applications, ranging from rudimentary navigation and location identification to mobility analysis.
Finally, in Section 4, we discuss limitations of the approach and possible directions of research and development to generate additional zoning systems for urban analysis.</p>

<a href="#the-clockboard-zoning-system" class="anchor"></a>The ClockBoard zoning system</h1>
<p>The aim of the ClockBoard zoning system is to tackle the issues associated with available zoning systems and to provide a standard template for analysis of the geographic distribution of urban phenomena between cities internationally.
As outlined above, there is a need for open access zoning systems that are readily available and consistent.</p>
<p>The requirements of urban analysts, geographers, transport modellers and others working with geographic data across cities are diverse. This motivated our approach to design a flexible open source system. Considering urban analysis research and visualisation requirements, we specified a set of criteria which state that zoning systems for urban analysis should:</p>
<ul>
<li>contain intuitively named zones, enabling public communication of research, e.g. with reference common perceptions of space in terms of distance from the city centre and direction relative to North</li>
<li>have a well-balanced number of zones since too many or too few zones may cause issues with analysis and visualisation
be easy to visualise without too many or too few zones</li>
<li>include zones of consistent and useful sizes, for example with zone areas increasing with distance from the urban centres to reflect relatively high densities in central locations</li>
<li>be ‘scale agnostic’, capable of representing a range of urban forms ranging from extensive cities such as Mexico City to compact cities such as Hong Kong</li>
<li>be extensible and based on open source software, enabling others to create alternative zoning systems suited to diverse needs</li>
</ul>
<p>Considering the above criteria, we explored many zoning options, some of which are illustrated in Figure <a href="#fig:options">1</a>.
Two key concepts that make up the zoning system described in this paper are concentric annuli and segments defined by radii.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Concentric rings</strong> — formally called ‘concentric annuli’ — which emphasise central locations and have been used to explore the relationships between the characteristics of ‘focal trees’ and surrounding trees in ecological research <span class="citation">(Wills et al. 2016)</span>, as shown in Figure <a href="#fig:options">1</a> (A).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Segments</strong>, defined by radial lines emanating from the central point of the settlement (or other geographic entity) to be divided into zones, as shown in Figure <a href="#fig:options">1</a> (B).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Combining these two concepts creates a general approach to zone creation that can be described as ‘segmented concentric annuli’, one specific implementation of which is shown in Figure <a href="#fig:options">1</a> (C).
After a period of informal testing and feedback, we developed and refined the ‘ClockBoard’ zoning system presented in this paper, which is a specific implementation of the segmented concentric annuli approach to zone creation.</p>
<p>The parameters that define the ClockBoard zoning system were developed in an iterative process.
We experimented with a range of ways of dividing the concentric annuli into different zones by modifying the distances between rings (the annuli borders) and the number of segments per annulus.
It became apparent that zoning systems based on the two organising principles (and modifiable parameters) of concentric annuli and segments held promise, but selecting appropriate settings for each was key to the development of the ClockBoad zoning system, as outlined below.
<!-- commented out the next sentence as it's kind of obvious -->
<!-- The key parameters of annuli distances and number of segments are discussed below. --></p>

<div id="annuli-radii" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#annuli-radii" class="anchor"></a>Annuli radii</h2>
<p>Each annuli is defined by its inner and outer circle.
Given that the radius of the inner circle must the same as the radius of the preceding annuli to ensure geographically contiguity (no gaps) — except in the special case of the first and central annuli which has no inner circle (or an inner circle with a radius of zero) — the annuli sizes can be wholly defined by the sequence of numbers defining their out circle radii.</p>
<p>This sequence of numbers can increase by a fixed amount — e.g. with the outer border of each annuli being 1 km from the centre than the preceding annulus, as shown in Figure <a href="#fig:options">1</a> (C) — or by varying amounts.
In many cases it is useful for zones to be smaller near the centre of the study region surrounding cities.
This truism is often reflected in traffic analysis zones (TAZ) used for transport modelling, which tend to be smaller near central areas where more detail is most important for policy-relevant outputs <span class="citation">(Chandra et al. 2021)</span>.</p>
<p>After experimenting with various ways of incrementing the annuli width,
<!-- including in proportion to the square of the annuli index, -->
and considering the importance of easy to remember distances from central points from the perspective of readability, interpretation and simplicity of the system, we settled on linear increases in width as a sensible default for the ClockBoard zoning system.
This linear growth leads to distances between the outer circles of each annuli and the central point following in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_number">triangular number sequence</a> <span class="citation">(Ross and Knott 2019)</span>.
This means that all points in the first annuli (labelled A) are up to 1 km way from the city centre; a circle with a diameter of 1 km is an easy to remember (albeit not always accurate) way to define the central area of urban areas <span class="citation">(Vinoth Kumar, Pathan, and Bhanderi 2007)</span>.
The furthest points from the central point of the next 8 subsequent annuli in the system (annuli B to I) are 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36 and 45 km respectively, meaning that even a large city such as London requires only 8 annuli to cover it entirely (Figure <a href="#fig:london">2</a>).

<a href="#number-of-segments" class="anchor"></a>Number of segments</h2>
<p>As its name suggests, the ClockBoard zoning system has 12 segments, representing a compromise between specificity of zone identification and ease of comprehension.
On one hand, too few segments result in large and/or unusually shaped zones, as illustrated in a segmented concentric annuli zoning system with four segments per annuli developed by <span class="citation">Vinoth Kumar, Pathan, and Bhanderi (2007)</span> to model urban expansion.
On the other hand, too many segments would result in small zones and make the zone codes harder to understand: imagine a system with 256 segments and saying “I’m in zone E173”!</p>
<p>Another advantage of using 12 segments is that the angular distance between segments are well understood.
The ‘clock position’ system describes bearings with reference to the face of a clock, relative to the direction of travel or, as is the case with the ClockBoard zoning system, relative to true North.
Under this system, well established in navigation, “12 O’clock” means true North and 3, 6 and 9 O’clock mean East, South and West respectively <span class="citation">(Hart and Battiste 1991)</span>.
Following this convention, the ClockBoard zoning system aligns segment 12 with true North, enabling users to approximate their location in a city with reference to clock position .</p>

<p>The result of applying 12 segments and n concentric rings with external diameter increasing as triangular numbers, with n being sufficient to cover the city extent with, is the Clockboard zoning system.
As outlined in the Introduction, the primary motivation for developing the system was urban analysis and the description, visualisation and exploratory analysis of large cities with well-defined central areas such as London, as illustrated in Figure <a href="#fig:london">2</a>.</p>

<p>To enable easy access to the zoning system, we have implemented described above in free and open source software.</p>
<div id="the-zonebuilder-r-package" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#the-zonebuilder-r-package" class="anchor"></a>The zonebuilder R package</h3>
<p>The concepts were initially implemented in the statistical programming language R, which is available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=zonebuilder">CRAN</a>) and can be installed from the R command line as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

<p>After the package has been installed, its functions can be attached (made available) to the user’s workspace as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

<p>A simple zoning system for Tokyo can be created as follows, resulting in the map shown in Figure <a href="#fig:tokyo">3</a>:</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Note that the <code>n_circles</code> argument was set to 5, resulting in a zoning system 15 km in radius (see Table <a href="#tab:t1">1</a>).
This can be changed; replacing <code>5</code> with <code>9</code>, for example, would results in a zoning system with an outer circle radius of 45 km.
Furthermore, passing an object representing the geographic extent of Tokyo as a polygon to the <code>area</code> argument of the <code><a href="../reference/zb_zone.html">zb_zone()</a></code> function would result in a zoning system that is intersected by Tokyo’s boundary.
<!-- Todo: do this, need a .geojson or similar file representing Tokyo's extent. --></p>
<p>To make the project and resulting zones available to more people, we subsequently developed a Rust crate, that enables the creation of ClockBoard zones on all major platforms using a command line interface.
See <a href="https://github.com/zonebuilders/zonebuilder-rust">github.com/zonebuilders/zonebuilder-rust</a> for details.
<!-- After the Rust crate has been installed, the same zoning system for Tokyo illustrated above can be created with the following command: --></p>
<!-- ```bash -->
<!-- # todo: update -->
<!-- cargo run > zones.geojson -->
<!-- ``` -->
<p>To enable creation of ClockBoard zones for non-programmers and to encourage people to explore alternative zoning systems, we created a simple web application hosted at <a href="https://zonebuilders.github.io/zonebuilder-rust/">zonebuilders.github.io/zonebuilder-rust/</a> (see Figure <a href="#fig:interactive">4</a>). This app leverages the Rust implementation for generating ClockBoards, compiling it to WebAssembly and using the standard open-source <a href="https://leafletjs.com">leafletjs.com</a> mapping library as an interface.</p>

<a href="#applications" class="anchor"></a>Applications</h1>
<p>The zoning system presented in this paper is a specific implementation concentric segmented annuli, that was designed to support description, exploration and visualisation of monocentric cities.
The zoning system presented, and modifications of the system, could be useful in a range of other areas.
The examples below are designed to provide an insight into how the zoning system could be used.</p>
<div id="navigation-and-location" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#navigation-and-location" class="anchor"></a>Navigation and location</h2>
<p>The most basic application of the zoning system could be to provide approximate locations and navigation guidance to people in cities.
As demonstrated by location services such as ‘what3words’ and open source implementations such as ‘whatfreewords’ and ‘<a href="https://www.qalocate.com/solutions/geohashphrase/">goehashphrase</a>’, there is demand for easy-to-remember words/phrases to specify locations in situations where there is no address and where providing longitude/latitude coordinates may not be appropriate or possible <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="raposo_virtual_2019"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>.
While not the primary purpose of the ClockBoard zoning system, it can be used to communicate locations in a city.</p>
<p>We have tested this use case by using the zoning system to agree on meeting points to collaborate on the project.
An illustration of how the zoning system was used is shown in Figure <a href="#fig:location"><strong>??</strong></a>, which shows how the ClockBoard zoning system could be used to communicate key locations in a city, from the train station (zone A) to a park (zone C01) and on to the city of Bradford (zone E09) to orientate people new to the city and to describe geographically where things are located using a small amount of information (3 characters).
Without needing to process much data or look at the map, a person who is new to to the city would know that the park is relatively close to the rail station (between 3 and 6 km from the city centre) while Bradford in zone E09 is between 15 and 21 km from the city centre.
Of course the locations are not geographically specific; the zones would be used a broad brush descriptions of place locations before more detailed locations are provided, e.g. through a postcode, an address, or coordinates.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most cities have a radial plan around a central area, which is often a historic centre or a central business area. Typically, this centre is not only the geographic centre, but also the busiest area in terms of daytime population. Often the main nodes in the urban transport network are also located in or near the city centre. Note that many cities already consist of concentric rings, separated by a ring road. (See also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_centre" class="uri">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_centre</a> which describes the centre as the heart of the city)</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Some cities have two or more centres.
Many cities have a central business discrict or financial discrict which not always coinsides with the historic city centre.</p></li>
<li><p>In urban areas with nearby cities, it may not always be clear where one cities ends and another begins.
Also, small cities may be located within the metropolitan area of a larger city (e.g. the Dutch cities The Hague/Delft)</p></li>

However, there are a couple of downsides to using administrative regions. First of all, since a city and its politics change over time, the administrative regions often change accordingly. This make it harder to do time series analysis. Since the administrative regions have heterogeneous characteristics, for instance population size, area size, proximity to the city centre, comparing different administrative regions within a city is not straightforward. Moreover, comparing administrative regions across cities is even more challenging since average scale of an administrative region may vary a lot across cities. --><!-- Another downside from a statistical point of view is that population densities are not uniform within a urban area, but concentrated around a centre. As a consequence, high resolution statistics is preferable in the dense areas, i.e. the centre, and lower resolution statitics in other parts of the city. That is the reason why administrative regions are often smaller in dense areas. --><!-- ### Why is it needed/handy? --><!-- * Locating cities. By having a ClockBoard zoning system for a city, it is immediate clear where the city centre is, and what the scale of the city is.  --><!-- * Reference system of everyday live. The zone name contains information about the distance to the center as well as the cardinal direction. E.g "I live in C12 and work in B3." or "The train station is in the center and our hotel is in B7". Moreover, the zones indicate whether walking and cycling is a feasibly option regarding the distance.    --><!-- * Aggregation for descriptive statistics / comparability over cities. By using the zoning system to aggregate statistics (e.g. on population density, air quality, bicycle use, number of dwellings), cities can easily be compared to each other. --><!-- * Modelling urban cities. The zoning system can be used to model urban mobility. --><!-- ### Arguments / discussion --><!-- Pros: --><!-- * Most cities have a radial plan around a central area, which is often a historic centre or a central business area. --><!-- Typically, this centre is not only the geographic centre, but also the busiest area in terms of daytime population.
