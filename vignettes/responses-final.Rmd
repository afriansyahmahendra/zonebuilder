We are very happy to resubmit the paper with minor updates requested.

We have updated Figure 7, which we agree looks much better with the city boundaries overlaid over the ClockBoard zones.

We agree the inter-city comparison aspect of the zoning system is the strongest unique feature of the approach.
We are less sure than Reviewer 2 that others will not find it useful for other purposes, and cannot predict how people will use it.
In response to the critique, which we broadly agree with, we have emphasized inter-city comparison aspects of the system.

We have updated the abstract to mention inter-city comparisons.
We have updated the bullet points outlining the motivations for the paper to make it clear that inter-city comparison was the most important motivation.
There is an interesting debate to be had about the extent to which the ClockBoard zoning system lives up to the motivating principles that initiated the research, that we engage in towards the end of the paper.
However, we think it important to state upfront the motivations.

We disagree that we evaluate the system based on legibility.
In fact we discuss in the limitations the fact that the system has not been evaluated, and suggest ways to evaluate the approach and its uses in future research:

> While informal and anecdotal feedback has been positive, user testing is needed to identify for which of the potential applications outlined in this paper the ClockBoard system is best suited.
Such user testing could be based on established approaches for evaluating digital products, including focus groups, surveys or interviews with potential users

However, we agree that academics, the most likely audience of the paper, will primarily find the system useful for comparing cities and have acted on this insight accordingly.

In terms of the specifice comments:

- We have updated the text referring to the effects of the MAUP, which is now more clear: "The aim is to provide a 'ready made' zoning system that can demonstrate and to some extent control for (between cities) the effects of the MAUP by providing another way to aggregate and present data."

- Good point about impact of irregular shapes and variability. We have updated the prose to make it clear that irregular shapes can disguise spatial patterns, as illustrated in Figure 6, which we now use as a concrete example of what we're talking about.

- We agree, it's not about locating phenomena so much as spatial entities and places, good point. We have updated the prose accordingly.

- We think that the uniqueness of the zoning system is not relevant to the motivations and we think that the uniqueness or otherwise of the system is covered well in other places in the paper, particularly in the discussion.  However, we have emphasised that the comparison between cities is a key contribution.
